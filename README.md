# Diffusion Models for Robotic Manipulation

This repository contains code and resources for learning and implementing diffusion models. The ultimate goal is to apply these models to robotic manipulation tasks.

## Overview

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have shown promising results in various domains, including image generation, audio synthesis, and more recently, in robotics. This project aims to explore the application of diffusion models in the context of robotic manipulation.
